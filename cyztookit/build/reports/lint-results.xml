        id="IconMissingDensityFolder"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Missing density variation folders in `res`: drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi, drawable-xxhdpi"
        category="Usability:Icons"
        priority="3"
        summary="Missing density folder"
        explanation="Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high). This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as `drawable-hdpi`.&#xA;&#xA;Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"
